Small CGI script that scans a network range and reports hostnames, IPs, MAC address and MAC vendor.

Written in Perl. Requires [PLP](https://metacpan.org/pod/PLP) modules.
Uses nmap and arp commands.

Now remember changes between scans: displays newly appeared IPs on green background, and disappeared one on orange background.
